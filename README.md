# Simple Board Game

## Introduction
This is a basic implementation of a board game where the player (represented by ü§†) navigates through a checkerboard to avoid collision with the computer (represented by üêç). The game is played on an 8x8 grid.

## How to Play

2. Use arrow keys (ArrowLeft, ArrowRight, ArrowUp, ArrowDown) to move the player around the board.
3. The computer moves randomly after each player's turn.
4. The objective is to avoid getting caught by the computer.
5. If the player and computer occupy the same square, the game is over, and the collision is marked with ‚ò†Ô∏è on the board.
